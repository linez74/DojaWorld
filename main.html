            <p class="Arial" style="font-size:20px; line-height:30px;"><b>Amala Ratna Zandile Dlamini</b> was born on
                October 21, 1995 into an artistic family in Tarzana, Los Angeles.
                Her mother, <b>Deborah Elizabeth Sawyer</b>, is a Jewish-American painter.
                <br>Her father, <b>Dumisani Dlamini</b>, is a South African actor, composer and film producer of Zulu
                ethnicity best known for Sarafina! <br>Doja Cat has stated that her father was absent from her childhood
                and has claimed that she has "never met him."
                She explained to <b>The Fader</b> that she did not <q> hold grudges against him or anything in any way, but
                    obviously it’s a little weird </q> that he would actively comment on her Instagram posts about how
                proud he
                was.
                Her father however has denied these statements, stating he has a "healthy" relationship with his
                daughter.

                <br>
                <br>
                Following her birth, Dlamini and her mother immediately moved to Rye, New York, where they lived for
                five years. <br>She returned to Oak Park, California with her single mother, where she experienced a
                "sporty childhood", often skating and visiting Malibu for surf camps.
                It was during this time when she participated in ballet, tap and jazz lessons. <br>Her mother played
                music from artists such as D’Angelo, Jamiroquai, Tupac, Earth, Wind & Fire and Erykah Badu in the house.
                She returned to Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles at the age of 11 and a half, where she lived in an ashram and
                practiced Hinduism for four years.
                <br> During this time she also took part in breakdancing classes, further joining a competitive troupe.
                She would frequently skip school to participate in chatrooms.
                She told Paper that she had a near-"religious" obsession with the unnamed chat room, and would still
                participate in it as of December 2019.

                Doja Cat dropped out of high school at age 16 while in junior year, and spent time downloading beats
                from YouTube to create her own music.
                She taught herself to use GarageBand. She has mentioned that life after dropping out of high school was
                "messy."
                For the first few months, she would upload songs onto SoundCloud and quickly take them down, until "So
                High" in late 2012, which she remembers crying over after attracting 12 views.
                She got her stage name, "Doja Cat", from one of her cats and her favored strain of marijuana. She
                stated
            <blockquote>
                <p style="font-size: 25px; line-height: 30px; font-weight: bold;text-align: center;">"I was heavily
                    addicted to weed and weed culture, so when I began rapping I thought of the word
                    'doja' and how it sounds like a girl's name."</p>
            </blockquote>
            </p>
            <p class="Arial" style="font-size: 20px;line-height: 30px;"><br>
                At age 17, Doja Cat signed to RCA Records with a joint venture deal with Dr. Luke's vanity label,<b>
                    Kemosabe Records</b>, in 2014. She signed to them in late 2013 but the deal was finalised in early
                2014.
                <br>She has declined to comment on her connection with Luke through Kemosabe. Later that year, Doja Cat
                released her debut EP, <i><b>Purrr!</b></i> , which was described as "spacey, eastern-influenced R&B" by
                <b>The Fader</b>.
                <br>"So High" was re-released as a single prior to the EP's release. The song was also featured on the
                TV series <b>Empire</b> in the third episode of the first season. She continued to release music on
                SoundCloud as she started gaining more attention.
                <br>In mid-2015,<b> OG Maco</b> announced via Twitter that Doja Cat had signed to his label, OGG.
                Following the reported signing, in late 2016, the two artists collaborated on "Monster" off of Maco's
                mixtape, <b>Children of the Rage (2017)</b>.
                By then she had also started collaborating with other artists, such as her Kemosabe label-mate
                <B>Elliphant</B>, and Soundcloud-based rappers <B>Skoolie Escobar</B>, <b>Pregnant Boy</b> and
                <b>frumhere</b>.

                On February 1, 2018, Doja Cat released the promotional single "Roll with Us", which entered Spotify's
                Global
                Viral 50 chart upon release.
                On March 9, 2018, she released the lead single, "Go to Town", which was released with an accompanying
                music video on the same day.
                "Candy" was released as the album's second single on March 23, 2018. <br><br>
                Consequently, the single charted in countries such as Australia, Canada and the United States, the
                latter
                having the song peak at 86 on the Billboard Hot 100 making it her first solo entry on the chart.
                On March 30, 2018, Doja Cat's debut studio album <i><b>Amala</b></i> was released, including the three
                singles. She later claimed to have been under the influence for most of the production of the album. NPR
                described the album as a
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p style="font-size: 25px; line-height: 30px; font-weight: bold;text-align: center;">"Manifesto of a
                    young woman striving to take ownership of her craft, her image and
                    her sexuality, mixing genres like dancehall, trap, house and R&B with a healthy dose of sass and
                    humor."</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="Arial" style="font-size: 20px;line-height: 30px;">Most of the tracks on Amala were co-produced by
                her frequent collaborator, <b>Yeti Beats</b>, who also
                executively produced the album. At the time of its release, the album was largely ignored by critics and
                failed to chart within the top 200 selling albums released that week.
                Doja Cat continued to promote the album herself on social media platforms as well as touring for the
                album
                with the Amala Spring Tour and Amala Fall Tour respectively throughout 2018 and 2019.

                On August 10, 2018, Doja Cat uploaded the completely self-produced music video "Mooo!" on YouTube. The
                single is a novelty song with absurdist lyrics where she fantasizes about being a cow.
                The video gathered attention and praise from popular artists such as <b>Chance the Rapper</b>, <b>Katy
                    Perry</b> and <b>Chris Brown</b>. Due to popular demand following the music video's viral success,
                Doja Cat released a single version of "Mooo!" on August 31, 2018.<br>
                <br>In February 2019, Doja Cat released the single and accompanying video for "Tia Tamera" featuring
                <b>Rico Nasty</b>, which preceded the release of a deluxe edition of <b><i>Amala</i></b>. The re-release

                Cat that was co-produced by her label boss, <b>Dr. Luke</b>. <br>Her <i>ColorsXStudios</i> performance
                of the
                latter song from March 2019, garnered over 21 million views on YouTube.
                A remix of "Juicy" featuring <b>Tyga</b> and its accompanying music video were released in August 2019.
                Following the release of the remix, the song debuted at 83 on the Billboard Hot 100, marking Doja Cat's
                first entry on the chart, and ultimately peaked at 41. The song would eventually be certified Platinum
